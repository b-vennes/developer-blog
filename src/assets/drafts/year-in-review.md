When I graduated from university in Sping 2019 I couldn't wait to get into the industry and start getting my hands on real software projects.  For some background on my experience, I started full-time at my current company last May as an automation developer and later switched over to the development team in September.  I've learned a lot over the last year and want to reflect on some of the particulars.

## It Takes More Than An Hour To Understand a Technology

When I moved to the development team, I started learning about and consuming information on full-stack development technologies very quickly.  I was watching every tutorial and guide that I could get my hands on.  I felt like I was learning lots of new technologies at a rapid pace.  In the span of a few weeks I began to view myself as a master developer.

However, despite feeling confident in my skills, I was not proficient in the technologies that I was learning.  I had fallen into the trap of not knowing what I didn't know.  I did a little research on this topic, and sure enough, it's the [Dunning-Kruger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) effect.

What does this mean for software developers?  We can't assume we have the ability to implement a technology or understand its implementation after spending an hour learning what it is.  The effect may also be accountable for why so many developers jump positions after a short amount of time in their current position (including myself).  As junior developers especially, we need to slow down and be patient with ourselves. The promotions, responsibilites, and raises will come with more experience.

## Don't Assume Confusing Code Is Bad

This one took me a while to learn. On multple cases while working as both an SDET and developer I would run across codethat I didn't quite get on first glance. I would think, "Whomever wrote this code clearly has no idea what they are doing, let me scrap everything and redo it". Then, after spending hours rethinking and reworking the code I end up with a component that is more complex and confusing than the code I started with.
